Project Name: The Daily Cat

Application Description: We will develop a website that gives random cat facts in case you’re interested in getting one! Our application allows users to generate cat facts by clicking a button and submitting their own cat facts so other users can also see. Users can also search for specific information using keywords.
Features + Tools/Technologies: 
a button that generates random cat facts. We will use a public cat API.
A box allowing users to submit their facts. We will need JavaScript.
Search function. We will need JavaScript and programming to decipher keywords to find relevant cat facts.
Database to save user’s submitted cat facts. Will need to create a database with JavaScript.
Cute website! We will use CSS (animated cute cat emojis)
